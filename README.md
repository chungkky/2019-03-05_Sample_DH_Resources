## Sample Digital Humanities Resources for Your Exploration
Highly selected DH resources originally complied for Prof. Matt Sergi's undergraduate 
English medieval drama class, Dept of English, University of Toronto, 6 March 2019.  
First compiled by Kathy Chung, 5 March 2019  
**Last Update: 2020-03-19**

**Background:**  This resource is complied by me, Kathy Chung, Research Associate at the Records of Early English Drama (REED), University of Toronto.  It makes no claim to being even remotely comprehensive or authoritative.  It's original goal was an easy way to share some of my own discoveries with others and offering to DH "beginners" a glimpse of to what's out there. It is updated now and again when I have time.  (Please let me know if any link is broken and I'll revise as needed.)

"You should not lose your self-sufficient state of mind. This does not mean a closed mind, but actually an empty mind and a ready mind. If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few." -- Shunryu Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_
